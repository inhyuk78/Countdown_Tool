# Countdown_Tool
This repository contains all the files necessary for my Countdown Tool project.

Project overview:

The Countdown Tool is a simple Flask web application that calculates the time remaining until a specified end date. It was built primarily as a learning project to explore the fundamentals of Flask and web app development.

Purpose:
1) Learn and practice Flask, including routing, HTML templating (Jinja2), and session handling.
2) Build the foundational knowledge needed to apply Flask concepts to my other ongoing project.
3) Create a personal countdown calculator that quickly shows the time left until a chosen date.
4) Keep track of my learning progress.

How to run the project:
1) Clone or download this repository.
2) Install all libraries listed in requirements.txt
3) Run 'python app.py' and open your browser to go to the website running on the local server.
